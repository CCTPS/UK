# Covid 19 Contact Tracing UK Government App - Privacy & Security
This repository contains documents and other information related to the UK covid 19 tracking app of interest to a community of those interested in the privacy and security aspects of the app.
# Who Are We
This repository was setup by a group of academics and researchers who have a particular interest in privacy and security, specifically as it applies to the contact tracing apps being proposed by various governments.  We hope the information collected here may also help inform the wider public so that they can make a reasoned judgement about the risks to their privacy posed by the UK app, and if that privacy risk is one worth taking for the public health benefits it delivers.

Prompted by evidence given in the [UK Parliament's Select Committee on Scinece and Technology](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-and-technology-committee-commons/news/146111/committee-holds-evidence-session-on-the-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-measures/) a number of academics and researchers in the fields of privacy, security and cryptography drafted and signed an [open letter](Joint%20Statement.pdf).  The majority of the signatories are not epidemiologists or public health experts.  However, it is important to continue to scrutinise the privacy and security aspects of this app regardless of what the epidemiologists and public health experts say is required.

This repository is intended to capture what is learned following the letter.

# Developments Since Open Letter
## 2nd May 2020
Those identified as media contacts in the [open letter](Joint%20Statement.pdf) (Eerke Boiten, Mark Ryan and Alan Woodward) were invited to discuss the points raised in the letter with the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, [Lord James Bethell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bethell,_5th_Baron_Bethell).
The opening remarks given by those who attended (the media contacts) is [summarised in this note](DIscussion%20of%20Privacy%20Risk%20In%20NHSX%20App.pdf).
At the meeting the minister responded very positively and undertook to write a letter giving a number of assurances, including that the government would be as transparent as possible given the constraints of having to develop this application "at speed".  This letter appeared later, [here](Letter%20on%20the%20NHSx%20App%20from%20PS(I)%20.pdf).
## 4th May 2020
There was an oral session at the Human Rights Select Committee that [took evidence from witnesses](https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/6f0f52cf-9fda-4785-bf63-af156d18b6c7) with specific emphasis on privacy implications of the UK approach to the contact tracing app.

In preparation for thie oral evidence the ICO issued a [written statement](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2617676/ico-contact-tracing-recommendations.pdf) on the subject.

Following this session the UK tracing app was formally launched by NHSX at an event in No10, and simultaneously documentation was released by [NCSC giving more technical details of the privacy and security design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/NHS-app-security-paper%20V0.1.pdf).
## 7th May 2020
As he promised on 2nd May 2020, the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care [wrote a letter](Letter%20on%20the%20NHSx%20App%20from%20PS(I)%20.pdf) setting out the current position on the NHSX contact tracing app.

On the same day NHSX made public the [Github respository containing the source code of the beta version of their app](https://github.com/NHSX), along with a number of [technical documents](https://github.com/nhsx/COVID-19-app-Documentation-BETA).

Also on this day the Chair of the Human Rights Committee [wrote](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1026/documents/8461/default/) to the Sedretary of State for Health & Social Care proposing legilsation whichn included protections for data collected by the contact tracing app.
## 8th May 2020
NHSx published its [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](https://faq.covid19.nhs.uk/DPIA%20COVID-19%20App%20PILOT%20LIVE%20RELEASE%20Isle%20of%20Wight%20Version%201.0.pdf) for contact tracing app as used in the live Isle of Wight trials.
## 13th May 2020
NHSx today made public the original [letter from Prof Sir Jonathan Montgomery](https://nhsbsa-socialtracking.powerappsportals.com/EAB%20Letter%20to%20NHSx.pdf) (Chair of Ethics Committee for the app) plus the [government response](https://nhsbsa-socialtracking.powerappsportals.com/Response%20to%20the%20EAB%20Letter%20%28Ethics%20Statement%29.pdf).
## 21st May 2020
The Secretary of State for Health & Social Care, Matt Hancock, has [written a second time to the Joint Human Rights Committee](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/1223/documents/10345/default/) stating that the government do not believe further legilsation is required, specifically to protect data collected by the NHS contact tracing app. 
## 18th June 2020
Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced that the NHS would no longer be persuing its original technical approach, and would seek to swicth the the Google/Apple API designed to supoort using Bluetooth based apps as a background task. the [story was documented by the BBC.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53095336)
