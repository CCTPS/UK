# Covid 19 Contact Tracing UK Government App - Privacy & Security
This respoistory contains documents and other information related to the UK covid 19 tracking app of interest to a community of those interested in the privacy and security aspects of the app.
# Who Are We
This respository was setup by a group of academics and researchers who have a particular interest in privacy and security, speciically as it applies to the contact tracing apps being proposed by various governments.  We hope the information collected here may also help inform the wider public so that they can make a reasoned judgement about the risks to their privacy posed by the UK app, and if that privacy risk is one worth taking for the public health benefits it delivers.

Prompted by evience given in the [UK Parliament's Select Committee on Scinece and Technology](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/135/science-and-technology-committee-commons/news/146111/committee-holds-evidence-session-on-the-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-measures/) a number of academics and researchers drafted and signed an [open letter](Joint%20Statement.pdf).  This respositiory is intended to capture what is learned as a result.
